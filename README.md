spcom-111-impressions
=====================

Automated application in C++ that compiles all the impressions of individual students per section.

This application aims to speed up the typing process of more than thousands of lines of plain text by systematically looping through the students in a section, prompting for their impression and compiling them at the end.

Directions
=====================

On the same directory that it is compiled:

1) Create a list of all the students in the same order of the impression list.

2) Create a folder for the section.

3) Follow directions as prompted in the program.
